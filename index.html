      <div class="about-me">
        <p>
          I am a <strong>Certified Pega Senior System Architect</strong> with over 8 years of experience designing and delivering innovative, scalable solutions across the financial services, insurance, and healthcare industries. With deep expertise in the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and a strong command of Agile Scrum methodologies, I transform complex business challenges into seamless, high-performance Pega applications that drive efficiency and elevate user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical expertise spans the design of robust <strong>Enterprise Class Structures (ECS)</strong> and the seamless integration of external systems through <strong>REST and SOAP APIs</strong>, <strong>Kafka</strong>, <strong>IBM FileNet</strong>, <strong>Amazon S3</strong>, and <strong>Message Queues (MQ)</strong>. I have implemented secure communication using <strong>Basic Authentication</strong> and <strong>OAuth 2.0</strong>, alongside enforcing <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> and <strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong> to ensure data protection and compliance. I have successfully led <strong>archival and purge initiatives</strong>, replacing legacy systems like the <strong>Universal Archival Solution (UAS)</strong> with modern, efficient alternatives. My experience extends across Pega frameworks such as <strong>Smart Dispute</strong>, <strong>Smart Claim Engine</strong>, <strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong>, and <strong>Customer Service</strong>, as well as <strong>compliance workflows</strong>, all tailored to enhance operational efficiency and meet regulatory standards.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          With a strong command of Pega rules and tools—including <strong>Activities</strong>, <strong>Data Transforms</strong>, <strong>Tracer</strong>, <strong>Clipboard</strong>, <strong>Live UI</strong>, 
          <strong>Pega Predictive Diagnostic Cloud (PDC)</strong>, and <strong>Dynatrace</strong>. I deliver precision in every deployment. My expertise
           extends to background processing through <strong>Agents</strong> and <strong>Job Schedulers</strong>, ensuring reliable automation 
           and task execution. From generating files using <strong>Connect-File</strong> rules (now deprecated) to managing real-time data via <strong>Connect-SQL</strong>, I focus on performance optimization and long-term maintainability. I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with <strong>DevOps teams</strong> to streamline deployments and maintain comprehensive technical documentation for scalability and ongoing support.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I stay at the forefront of Pega technologies. Whether leveraging Out-of-the-Box features, delegating rules for business user autonomy, or building intelligent case management systems, I am passionate about creating solutions that are not only functional, but transformative.
